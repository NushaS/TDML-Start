This is the skeleton for a Trip Down Memory Lane

The link takes you to the initial Login Page known as the Index.html file in the code
Currently, we have not figured out how to make specific credentials for each user, so you may type in anything for your username and password and hit Login

The Login button will take you to the Home page which is represented by the Home.html file
From there, you are free to clink any of the following links which will take you to different pages of the site
On the Home page you can also click the Go To Map which will take you to a blank Google Maps page
